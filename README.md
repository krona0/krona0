👋 About Me

Hi, I’m a self-taught developer from China, currently on a journey to become a front-end engineer and, ultimately, an independent developer. My biggest dream is to study Computer Science at MIT, and I’m working step by step to make it real.

💻 What I’m Doing Now (2025 Goals)
	•	Preparing for IELTS, aiming for a 7.0 score.
	•	Learning front-end development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), building my own blog and personal projects.
	•	Studying MIT’s open Computer Science courses in Chinese first, and later in English.
	•	Researching Web3 and blockchain technology.
	•	Doing independent analysis of cryptocurrency markets.

🎯 What I Plan Next (2026 Goals)
	•	Polish my front-end skills to match real-world job needs.
	•	Start applying for remote developer jobs.
	•	Re-learn the full Computer Science curriculum in English and organize my notes.
	•	Prepare and apply to U.S. universities, with the ultimate goal of going to MIT.

🔧 Skills in Progress
	•	Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Blockchain: Web3, Crypto Research
